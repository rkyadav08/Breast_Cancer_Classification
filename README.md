# Breast_Cancer_Classification
This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook for classifying breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset. The project explores various ML models and evaluates their performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.
